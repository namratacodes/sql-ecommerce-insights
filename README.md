# 🛒 E-Commerce Sales Insights — SQL Analysis Project

> Analyzing a real e-commerce database to extract actionable business insights using advanced SQL techniques.

## 📌 Project Overview

This project simulates a real-world Data Analyst role where I was given access to an e-commerce database and tasked with answering 15 critical business questions using SQL.

The analysis covers sales performance, customer behavior, product trends, office efficiency, and revenue growth patterns — all derived purely through SQL queries on a relational database.

## 🗄️ Database Schema

The **ClassicModels** database contains 8 interconnected tables:

```
offices ──► employees ──► customers ──► orders ──► orderdetails
                                    │                    │
                              payments             products
                                                       │
                                               productlines
```

| Table | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `customers` | Customer details and assigned sales rep |
| `orders` | Order transactions with dates and status |
| `orderdetails` | Line items per order (product, quantity, price) |
| `products` | Product catalog with stock levels |
| `productlines` | Product categories |
| `employees` | Sales representatives and staff |

## 💡 Key Business Findings

### 📈 Seasonality Pattern
> **November consistently shows the highest revenue every year.**
> The business should increase inventory, staffing, and marketing spend before October to capitalize on this pattern.

### 🏆 Top Performers
> - **Best Sales Rep by Revenue:** Gerard Hernandez
> - **Best Sales Rep by Customer Count:** Pamela Castillo
> - **Key Insight:** Gerard generates more revenue with fewer customers — indicating higher-value deals. His strategy should be studied and replicated.

### 🚗 Product Intelligence
> - **Classic Cars** dominate revenue across all product lines
> - **1992 Ferrari 360 Spider Red** is the top revenue-generating product — driven by high sales volume, not just high price
> - **Trains** underperform even on a per-product basis — discontinuation worth evaluating

### 🏢 Office Performance
> - **Paris office** leads in total sales revenue
> - **USA** dominates as a country overall

### 👑 Customer Loyalty
> - **Euro+ Shopping Channel** is the highest-value customer by both payment amount ($715K+) and order frequency
> - Only 2 customers qualify as "Gold tier" (5+ orders) — loyalty program opportunity

### 📊 Revenue Milestone
> **Total Revenue across all years: $9,604,190.61**
> Validated independently via two different query approaches — confirming data integrity.
